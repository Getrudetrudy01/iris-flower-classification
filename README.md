# Iris Flower Species Classification

This repository contains a machine learning project for classifying the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. The Iris dataset is a popular dataset in the field of machine learning and is often used for classification tasks.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains measurements of Iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The measurements include the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width of the flowers. The dataset is well-known and widely used, consisting of 150 instances with 50 instances per species. This dataset was gotten from kaggle.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. By training a model on the available dataset, we aim to create a classifier that can generalize well to unseen Iris flowers and correctly predict their species.

## Project Files

The repository includes the following files:

1. `iris flower classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code implementation of the machine learning model. This notebook provides step-by-step instructions and explanations of the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation processes.

2. `iris.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model. The file includes the measurements of Iris flowers (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) as well as the corresponding species labels.

3. `requirements.txt`: Text file listing the dependencies and required packages to run the Jupyter Notebook.

## How to Use

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Getrudetrudy01/iris-flower-classification.git
   ```

2. Install the required packages by running the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `iris flower classification.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

4. Run the code cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, train the machine learning model, and evaluate its performance.

## Results

The machine learning model achieves an accuracy of X% on the test set, showcasing its ability to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements. The notebook includes visualizations and metrics to assess the model's performance.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for the classification of Iris flower species based on their measurements. By training a model on the Iris dataset, we have created a classifier that can effectively predict the species of Iris flowers with high accuracy.
